We shared the experimental datasets we used in ACL 2021 paper "Multi-TimeLine Summarization (MTLS): Improving Timeline Summarization by Generating Multiple Summaries". This dataset is constructed based on the previous TLS dataset published in G. B. Tran et al work [link](http://www.l3s.de/~gtran/timelin).
