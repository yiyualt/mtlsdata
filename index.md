We share the experimental datasets we used in ACL 2021 paper "Multi-TimeLine Summarization (MTLS): Improving Timeline Summarization by Generating Multiple Summaries". This dataset is constructed based on the previous TLS dataset published in G. B. Tran et al work ([link](http://www.l3s.de/~gtran/timeline/)). If you use mtls-dataset in your work, please cite **both** of the following work:
